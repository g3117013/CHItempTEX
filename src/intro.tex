\section{Introduction}

This format is to be used for submissions that are published in the
conference proceedings. We wish to give this volume a consistent,
high-quality appearance. We therefore ask that authors follow some
simple guidelines. You should format your paper exactly like this
document. The easiest way to do this is to replace the content with
your own material.  This document describes how to prepare your
submissions using \LaTeX.
