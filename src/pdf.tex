\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.
